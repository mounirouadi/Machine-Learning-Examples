# Machine Learning Code Examples
This repository contains a collection of machine learning code examples for various algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Polynomial Regression, as well as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) folder. Each folder contains both code written from scratch, as well as code using the scikit-learn library for easy comparison.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/<username>/machine-learning-code-examples.git`

## Folders

* K-Nearest Neighbors: Contains code for the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, both written from scratch and using scikit-learn.
* Linear Regression: Contains code for the Linear Regression algorithm, both written from scratch and using scikit-learn.
* Naive Bayes: Contains code for the Naive Bayes algorithm, both written from scratch and using scikit-learn.
* Polynomial Regression: Contains code for the Polynomial Regression algorithm, both written from scratch and using scikit-learn.
* NLP: Contains code for Natural Language Processing tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

The code examples in this repository are written in Python, and make use of the following libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* nltk

## Running the Code

Each code file can be run independently, you can run the code by navigating to the folder and running the file using `python filename.py`

## Note

All the codes are well commented for easy understanding and following.
